        I excel in transforming a design into living web components and interactions. I fill the gaps between
        the breakpoints and I design additional components following the look and feel of the origianl design.
        I love working collaboratively with Designers and other developers to make engaging and beautiful web applications.

        After 3 years of studying electrical engineering, while I was working for a microchip manufaturer,
        I took an abrupt turn toward web development by enrolling at Portland Code School. The last 2 years I have been creating web sites and
        backend styling/coding for a custom CMS built solution geared towards events, venues and destinations
        as well as picking up some freelance work along the way.
